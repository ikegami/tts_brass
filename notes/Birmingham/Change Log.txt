Title: Change Log

[2020-~~-~~ Kinithin]
- Players no longer have an infinite supply of links.
- Solve a problem where players couldn`t see the cards in their hands.
- Player tokens are now two-sided like in the physical game. A side is chosen randomly at game start.
- The scores are now announced in (reverse) order of placement. This uses the tie-breakers if required.
- A sound effect is now played any time the game becomes ready to be advanced, not just when it becomes someone’s turn.
- A visual element was added to a player’s turn notifications.
- Addressed the issue that could cause the score markers to topple over if multiple people had the same score at the end of scoring.
- The script no longer relies on the name and description fields of objects. This allows the game to be internationalized. GM Notes are used for internal data.
- Major internal changes to allow the code to be shared by both Brass: Lancashire and Brass: Birmingham.

[2020-09-15 Kinithin]
- Better handling of stacks and other misplaced items on the game board.
- Better handling of spectating (Grey) players and of players of a color not used by the game.
- Resolved a harmless “Can’t resolve guid” warning that occurred when loading a game saved during the Rail Era.
- When level 1 tiles are deleted at the start of the rail era, so are any resources on those tiles.
- Major internal changes (use of modules and promises) to ease future development.

[2020-08-25 Kinithin]
- Major overhaul. Entire script rewritten from scratch.
- Better reporting of actions taken by the script and users.
- Automatic scoring (with a chance to review)!
- The value of every link is automatically updated between every turn.
- Refills a player’s hand at the end of their turn (instead of at the end of the round).
- Checks that a player played sufficient cards before moving to the next player.
- Canals and level 1 industries are automatically cleared at the start of the rail era.
- Links now support 12 points, which the Birmingham-Coventry link is capable of granting.
- Links now default to a state with a value of 0.
- Links now snap (regardless of their state).
- New button makes increasing income easier.
- Moved the link bags to help purple avoid grabbing tiles when they meant to grab links.
- Fixed the maximum number of rounds displayed.
- Allows a discard pile to have three cards (to support the Scout action).
- Removed the need to tell the game the number of players that will be playing.
- Markers and tokens for unused player colors are now removed automatically.
- The orange player’s tray has been moved so that it’s not obscured by the chat window when viewing the whole board.
- The orangish-red color is now played by an orange player since red is used by error messages. (Same reason white is played by a teal player.)
- The coal and iron bags can now be moved or copied without messing anything up.
