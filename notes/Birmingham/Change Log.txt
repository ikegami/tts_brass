[2021-04-09 Kinithin]

[2020-12-21 Kinithin]
- Fixed a (basically harmless) error that would occur every 10s a player had a color other than those used by the mod.

[2020-12-19 Kinithin]
- Switched from using cards to using tiles for the industry tiles. This makes it more obvious that there are multiple of some tiles.
- Players no longer have an infinite supply of links.
- Solved a problem where players couldn’t see the cards in their hands.
- Player tokens are now two-sided like in the physical game. A side is chosen randomly at game start.
- The scores are now announced in (reverse) order of placement. This uses the tie-breakers if required.
- A sound effect is now played any time the game becomes ready to be advanced, not just when it becomes someone’s turn.
- A visual element was added to a player’s turn notifications.
- Addressed the issue that could cause the score markers to topple over if multiple people had the same score at the end of scoring.
- The script no longer relies on the name and description fields of objects. This allows the game to be internationalized. GM Notes are used for internal data.
- Major internal changes to allow the code to be shared by both Brass: Lancashire and Brass: Birmingham.

[2020-09-15 Kinithin]
- Better handling of stacks and other misplaced items on the game board.
- Better handling of spectating (Grey) players and of players of a color not used by the game.
- Resolved a harmless “Can’t resolve guid” warning that occurred when loading a game saved during the Rail Era.
- When level 1 tiles are deleted at the start of the rail era, so are any resources on those tiles.
- Major internal changes (use of modules and promises) to ease future development.

[2020-08-25 Kinithin]

- Markers and tokens for unused player colors are now removed automatically.
- The orange player’s tray has been moved so that it’s not obscured by the chat window when viewing the whole board.
- The orangish-red color is now played by an orange player since red is used by error messages. (Same reason white is played by a teal player.)

[2020-08-11 Kinithin]
