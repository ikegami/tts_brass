Welcome! Once everyone is seated, press either of the “Start Game” buttons to start.

The game gives chances to review and make correction at critical times:
- Income only happens when “Start the Next Round” and “Start the Rail Era” are clicked.
- Scoring only happens when “Score the Canal Era” is clicked.
- Clearing the board of links and industries only happens when “Start the Rail Era” is clicked.

When taking the Scout action, simply place the three cards in a discard pile.

Wild card should be placed in the discard pile just like as others.

The script is largely stateless. This means you can change/correct just about everything in the game, including:
- Available money
- Money spent
- Links and industries
- Cards
- Income and score markers
- Coal and iron markets
- Merchants and their beer

You can even change the turn order token. If this causes a player to be placed before the current player, perform the turns as it there was no scripting until it reaches the indicated player’s turn.

The script supports saving and reverting time.

The script is very tolerant of people dropping. The host and promoted players can click the game-advancing button even when it’s not their turn.

The value of links are updated with every click of the button.

“/execute start(n)” in the chat will start the game with missing players. (Use a number of players instead of “n”.)
