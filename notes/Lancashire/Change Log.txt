- Sound is cut if the game-advancing button is pressed while sound is still playing.

- Fixed a (basically harmless) error that would occur every 10s a player had a color other than those used by the mod.

- Initial version. Based on the Brass: Lancashire assets by Draxous and the Brass: Birmingham code by Kinithin. Thanks for Eldinâ€™s help with the model for the distant cotton market.
