- Sir Henry Bessemer no longer leans so far back.

- The game was disabling the loan button one round too soon.
- The game now checks for updates and advises the players where to get the newest version.
- The game-advancing button now shows as disabled when the game is busy and when in cool-down mode.
- Sound is cut if the game-advancing button is pressed while sound is still playing.

- Fixed a (basically harmless) error that would occur every 10s a player had a color other than those used by the mod.

- Initial version. Based on the Brass: Lancashire assets by Draxous and the Brass: Birmingham code by Kinithin. Thanks for Eldin’s help with the model for the distant cotton market.
